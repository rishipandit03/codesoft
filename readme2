This is an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI built for the CodSoft AI Internship (Task 2).
The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to always make the optimal move.
You can play against it in the terminal, and it will never lose (at best you can draw).

🛠 Tech Used
Python (Standard Library Only)
Minimax Algorithm
Alpha-Beta Pruning
Console-based user interaction
▶ How to Run
Save the file as tic_tac_toe_ai.py.
Run in terminal:
python tic_tac_toe_ai.py
Choose your symbol (X or O).
Play using positions 1–9:
 1 | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6

The AI will make its move automatically.
